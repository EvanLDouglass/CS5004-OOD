## Evan Douglass

This repository is divided into three directories, Homework, Labs and Tests.
'Homework' contains homework assignments, 'Labs' contains lab work, and 'Tests' contains computer based exams taken during the course.
Sub-directories are divided into separate assignments and problems as necessary, based on the write-up given in class.
